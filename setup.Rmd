During the course we will be using both R and RStudio. To get your computer ready for this course please follow the instructions under the **_Core Software_** heading.   

\  

## Core Software
**Install R.** You'll need R version **`r paste(R.Version()$major, ".", R.Version()$minor, sep="")`** or higher. Download and install R for [Windows](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/){target="_blank"},  [Mac](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/){target="_blank"} (download the latest R-3.x.x.pkg file for your appropriate version of Mac OS) or [linux](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux){target="_blank"} (choose your flavour of linux).

**Install RStudio.** Download and install the free [RStudio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/){target="_blank"} version.

You will need to download and install R and RStudio separately. **R** is the underlying statistical computing environment. **RStudio** is a graphical integrated development environment (IDE) that makes using R a little easier. You need to install R before you install RStudio.

See the following video for step by step instructionsto installing R and RStudio.
