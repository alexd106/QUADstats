# Here the intercept (baseline) is *NOT* the mean abundance of birds for
# FGRAZE level 1. It is the predicted `ABUND` for LOGAREA = 0 & FGRAZE level 1.
# the null hypothesis for the intercept is that the intercept = 0.
# As the p value (p < 2e-16) is very small we reject this null hypothesis
# and conclude that the intercept is significantly different from 0.
# Not a biologically relevant hypothesis test, in this context
# (in fact totally arbitrary, as the location of the zero is determined
# by the transformation we chose)

# For LOGAREA, the null hypothesis is that the slope of the relationship
# between LOGAREA and ABUND = 0 (no relationship)

# The remaining estimates are differences (contrasts) between each level
# and the reference level, FGRAZE1. 
# For example the FGRAZE2 estimate is 0.38, so there are 0.38 more birds on
# average in graze level 2 compared to graze level 1, *for a given patch area*.
# This difference is however not significantly different from zero (p = 0.89). 

# The difference between graze level 5 (FGRAZE5) and the reference FGRAZE1 is 
# -11.89 (11.89 fewer birds in graze 5 compared to graze 1),
# for *an identical patch area*.
# This difference is significantly different from 0 (p = 0.00017) and therefore
# the mean abundance of birds in graze level 5 is significantly lower than in
# graze level 1, for the same patch area.

# The Multiple R-square value is as we calculated from the anova table
