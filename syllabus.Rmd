The course will start at 09:30 each morning and finish at 17:00. We will break for a one hour lunch break around 12:30. However, everyone learns R and statistics in their own way and at their own pace so this syllabus should be treated as indicative rather than absolute. There will also be plenty of opportunities to take short breaks during the course.

<!--All teaching will be held in room FN113 in the Fraser Noble building (building No. 7 on [this map](images/uoa_map.png){target="_blank"} on the old Aberdeen campus).
